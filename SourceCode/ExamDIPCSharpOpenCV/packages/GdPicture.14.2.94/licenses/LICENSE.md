\======================================================

**1) INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS**

1.1. This Agreement is a license agreement between you and ORPALIS (the "Author") for the use of the computer software development kit (the “SDK”) you have purchased or downloaded for evaluation purposes ("GdPicture.NET" and/or “DocuVieware” at current major version).

1.2. We, ORPALIS (the "Author") reserve the right to modify at whenever required time, the content of this Agreement (“Agreement” or “EULA”).

1.3. You accept this Agreement by clicking the "I accept" button where this option is made available to you by us, ORPALIS (the "Author") in the user interface regarding End User License Agreement (EULA) of our products.

1.4. By using GdPicture.NET products (including DocuVieware), either by evaluating or purchasing it, you agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

1.5. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and us, ORPALIS (the "Author") and supersedes any other communication or advertising with respect to GdPicture.NET and related products. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

1.6 “User” and “End User” means a person or an entity that installs or uses the SDK or Documentation.


**2) EDITIONS**

2.1. GdPicture.NET SDK is a Software Development Kit (SDK). 

DocuVieware is another Software Development Kit (SDK) having a dependency on GdPicture.NET SDK.

2.2 Both software are bundled into the same Software Package (or installation kit).

2.3 Each GdPicture.NET SDK developer license includes a DocuVieware developer license. In other words  DocuVieware development licenses are bundled with GdPicture.NET SDK (see 3.3.1).


**3) DOCUVIEWARE**

3.1 DocuVieware is a universal HTML5 Viewer and Document Management toolkit, a standalone product whose licensing rules are stated as below.
3.2 DocuVieware licensing comprises:
-DocuVieware development-licensing, and
-DocuVieware distribution-licensing.

3.3 DocuVieware development licensing
3.3.1 DocuVieware development licenses are bundled with GdPicture.NET SDK and, therefore, are subject to all GdPicture.NET regulatory amendments, as specified below.
3.4. DocuVieware distribution licensing
3.4.1 In order to distribute your works that relate to DocuVieware, you will need to license distribution rights.
3.4.2 Distribution licensing concerns the rights to distribute your DocuVieware-based works and does not regulate your DocuVieware nor GdPicture.NET development rights. 
3.4.3 DocuVieware distribution licensing is Server-based.
3.4.4 The term "Server" with regard to DocuVieware distribution licensing is defined by us, ORPALIS, as a physical, or virtual machine, or computing device on which you have installed DocuVieware software in order to deploy and provide your DocuVieware-based works to your customers.
3.4.5 Server may have up to 4 vCPUs (or cores). IE: distributing DocuVieware on a Server having 8 vCPUs (or cores) require two deployment licenses.
3.4.6. You may distribute your unlimited works based-on (or linked-to) DocuVieware, on a Server once you have acquired a Server deployment license.
3.4.7 Each Server deployment requires a distribution licensing.
3.4.8 Unlimited distribution rights licensing is available solely upon direct negotiation.


**4) EVALUATION LICENSING**

4.1. “Evaluation License” allows a User to fully evaluate the SDK during an evaluation period of sixty (60) days from the date the SDK is first used.

The evaluation license key unlocks all features of the SDK for sixty (60) days.

4.2. The evaluation license is provided for evaluation purposes only, not for production use.

4.3. Evaluators requiring an evaluation period beyond the initial sixty (60) days can contact us by creating a sales support ticket.

4.4. Evaluation license usage is prohibited to develop/maintain an application already covered by a commercial GdPicture license. For example, if a developer is joining a team assigned to the development/maintenance of an application linking GdPicture under a commercial license agreement, this developer must have its own valid commercial license.* 


**5) COMMERCIAL LICENSING**

5.1. Three different license types are available for each of the GdPicture.NET editions:

a) per-developer license:

Based on the amount of seats purchased - this license type entitles 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 distinct Users and/or build machine(s), of the same organization at a single physical address to write software with access to the SDK..

b) site license:

This license type entitles an unlimited number of Users and/or build machine(s) of the same organization at a single physical address to write software with access to the SDK.

c) Worldwide license:

This license entitles an unlimited number of Users and/or build machine(s) of the same organization at an unlimited number of physical addresses to write software with access to the SDK.

5.2. The use of the SDK requires one license for each User within your organization who will launch the compilation process of any application linking the SDK. For example, if your organization has 3 developers, 2 of which will work directly with the SDK and another one will not work directly with the SDK but will nevertheless launch the compilation process of a project linking the SDK, you will need to purchase 2 + 1 = 3 licenses.

5.3. Licenses are non-transferable between Users. Therefore, if a company has "x" Users who will use the SDK, the company requires a "x" Users license purchased according to paragraph 5.1. above. The same provision applies if, for example, the Users will not be working with the SDK at the same time.

5.4 You are forbidden to disclose your license key(s) to third parties.

5.5 The same license cannot be used by two different companies.

5.6. You are not allowed to sell the SDK or your license key(s) to other persons or entities.

5.7. You are prohibited from disclosing your license key(s) to other persons or entities.

5.8. You are not allowed to disclose your license key(s) on the source code of a web page.

5.9. You may not rent, lease, sub-license, or transfer the SDK, SDK copies, documentation, license keys, or your rights under this license without the prior written consent of ORPALIS (the "Author").

5.10 Any owner of any application linking the SDK must own at least one commercial license. For example, if a company X is owning the intellectual property of any application developed or maintained by another company Y, both companies will have to own their* own licenses.


**6) USE OF THE SDK**

6.1. You may not alter, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer GdPicture.NET products, including DocuVieware.

6.2. **GdPicture.NET SDK may not be used to develop software toolkits, API, libraries, components, command-line software, REST API, or any kind of third-party software, except as authorized in writing by a duly authorized officer of ORPALIS. This includes internal usage.**

6.3. Binaries of legally purchased SDK may be embedded in any application or system developed by you or your organization as long the SDK is covered by an active SDK maintenance (see 9.4).

6.4. You may modify the source code versions of sample files, if any, included with the SDK for the purpose of creating your own application(s).

6.5. You may not remove or alter our copyright notices.

6.6. You are not allowed to use our name, logo, or trademarks to market your application without our prior written consent.


**7) GDPICTURE.NET SERVER AND WEB DEPLOYMENT**

7.1. This chapter is not related to DocuVieware distribution licensing nor to DocuVieware-based works deployment.
7.2. This chapter concerns GdPicture.NET SDK only.
7.3. No extra fees are charged for GdPicture.NET SDK server deployment.

7.4. GdPicture.NET SDK may be used on any server, as long as access to the functionalities of our components is done via your own software and into your own machine. In other words, the public should not have direct access to GdPicture.NET SDK binaries or key.

7.5. GdPicture.NET SDK may be installed on any third-party hosting server as long as each developer using GdPicture.NET SDK has its own license key.

7.6. GdPicture.NET SDK may be installed on a shared hosting server, provided that each customer accesses GdPicture.NET SDK with its own license key.

7.7. GdPicture.NET SDK may not be installed on a hosting provider's server with a single license key used by all the hosting provider's customers.

7.8. You are not allowed to publish web applications, using GdPicture.NET SDK on the client side.


**8) REDISTRIBUTION**

8.1. No royalties are payable for the re-distribution of the SDK.

8.2. Binaries of legally purchased SDK can be distributed with your application (desktop or server) on a royalty-free basis. This means that you can distribute as many applications using the SDK as you wish, without restrictions or royalties, as long the SDK is covered by an active SDK maintenance (see 9.5).

8.3. Redistribution of the SDK is granted during a period of twelve months following the acquisition date. A separate maintenance contract is required to extend the redistribution rights beyond the twelve months period following the acquisition date. 

8.4. You must distribute your application(s) under a written agreement that prohibits reverse engineering, decompilation, or disassembly of the applications(s) and clearly require from the customers of your application(s) to abide by the previously stated conditions.


**9) SDK MAINTENANCE**

9.1 The SDK is sold based on a yearly subscription model. An active SDK maintenance is required to install, use, or distribute the SDK.

9.2 An active SDK maintenance is automatically granted to owners of a commercial license during a period of twelve months which starts at the acquisition date. A separate annual maintenance contract (Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC)) is required to extend the SDK maintenance beyond the initial twelve months period.

9.3 An active SDK maintenance is required to install the SDK binaries for development purpose.

9.4 An active SDK maintenance is required to develop/maintain any application linking the SDK.

9.5 An active SDK maintenance is required to redistribute or allow installation of any application linking the SDK.
